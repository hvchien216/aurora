<!-- ## Database Migrations
SQL files in /supabase/migrations should:
- Use sequential numbering: 001, 002, etc.
- Include descriptive names
- Be reviewed by Cline before execution
Example: 001_create_users_table.sql -->

## Development Workflow
- Cline helps write and review code changes
- Vercel automatically deploys from main branch
- Database migrations reviewed by Cline before execution

<!-- ## Security
DO NOT read or modify:
- .env files
- **/config/secrets.*
- Any file containing API keys or credentials -->
